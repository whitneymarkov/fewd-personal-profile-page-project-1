        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I’m an aspiring web developer who has been dabbling in the field for over a decade. My design and developer roots were planted 14 years ago when I started creating layouts and graphics for profiles, shops, and guilds on Neopets.com, and have since grown.</p>
        <p>My first few years in Norway were spent learning the language and solidifying my previous education with the Norwegian system. Confident in my proficiency, I am now able to pursue my passion for web development.</p>

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>I want to master the process of creating pixel perfect websites that are responsive and optimised by increasing my knowledge, skills, and abilities in: </p>
        <ul class="skills">
          <li>HTML</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
          <li>JavaScript</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I would be delighted to join a web development team that focuses on creating solid, modern, user-friendly websites for their clients.</p>

        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <p>When I'm not designing web pages I spend a lot of time hiking with my other half and our tiny-but-fierce dachshund. The mountains surrounding Bergen are beautiful and being outdoors in nature is the way of life here. We also cha cha/samba/tango/waltz our way across a dance floor once a week!</p>
        <p>My husband and I met online playing Star Wars the Old Republic, and although we still frequent the MMORPG on a regular basis our main source of online play comes from Blizzards own Heroes of the Storm. Our entire group of friends (men and women alike) come together nearly every night to play at least a few rounds while chatting on our private Discord channel. We also take turns hosting get-togethers to watch tournaments, hold LAN parties, and play Dungeons and Dragons! I'm a huge sci-fi nerd so it's no surprise that my Netflix history consists of watching every season of Star Trek for what must be the millionth time. And being the avid reader that I am I go through three or four books a month, you'll never catch me without one!</p>
